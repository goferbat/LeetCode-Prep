## Notes

Hey, this is my github repo for coding interviews, figured I'd learn more if I wrote everything myself :)

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/declan-halbert-709317107/).

Currently looking for SDE roles in the NYC area!


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
